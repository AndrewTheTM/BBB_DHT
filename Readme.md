This is a simple interface to read a DHT-22 family of sensors with a 
Beaglebone Black.  Modeled after several libraries:

Adafruit's DHT Driver for Raspberry Pi: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Raspberry-Pi-Python-Code/tree/master/Adafruit_DHT_Driver

Nunoalves's BeagleBone_IO_lib: https://github.com/nunoalves/BeagleBone_IO_lib/

Currently in version 0: this hasn't been tested yet.
